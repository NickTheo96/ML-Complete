# Kernal Ridge Regression Algorithm
Implementation of kernel ridge regression using a polynomial and radial kernal

# Machine Learning Techniques: Predicting The Price Of Houses #
## Outline of Project ##

This is a repository implementing KRR (Kernal Ridge Regression) to predict the classification of various things. The dataset is included in the reposirory but it can also be found [here.](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv). The first column is the column id, the second is the advetising budget of the product for TV, the third the advertising budget for radio, the fourth the advertising budged for newspaper and the final column the sales of the product. KRR using a polynomial kernel was used to predict the sales of the product for different budges for TV, radio and newspaper advertising. 

## How to run the code ##
polynomial.R is the impelemtation of a polynomial kernel that when run loads in the Advertising.csv data and outputs the predictions.
