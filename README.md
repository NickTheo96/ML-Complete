# Machine Learning LabScripts
## Outline of Repositry ##
These are a collection of code created from the labs mainly kept on here for bookwork as it is easier for me to switch between my laptop and desktop using git hub. A brief outline of the course used to learn the material is included below.

## Outline of Course ##

* Week 1: Introduction to machine learning and to R
* Week 2: Nearest Neighbours and k-Nearest Neighbours 
* Week 3: Linear regression: simple and multiple linear regression, interaction terms, accuracy of model -RSE and R^2 static
* Week 4: Polynomial regression
* Week 5: Discriminant Analysis: Implementing LDA and QDA, ROC curve analysis
* Week 6: Model selection: Forward and backward stepwise selection
* Week 7: Ridge regression and the Lasso
